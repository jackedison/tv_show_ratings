# tv_show_ratings

This repo has code to:
1. Pull TV Show data from OMDB's free API just by being given the name of the TV show
2. Display data through various functions

Example rating visualisation for Game of Thrones:

This was a quick project to share visualisations with friends & a reddit post.

If you wish to run new TV shows you can list their name in the `if __name__ == __main__` in `main.py` and run `main.py` to generate the new models.
