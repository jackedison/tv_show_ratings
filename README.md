# tv_show_ratings

This repo has code to:
1. Pull TV Show data from OMDB's free API just by being given the name of the TV show
2. Display data through various functions

Example rating visualisations in Ratings/

This was a quick project to share visualisations with friends & a reddit post.

If you wish to run new TV shows you can list their name in the `if __name__ == __main__` in `main.py` and run `main.py` to generate the new models.
